hey, dotfiles

I place this directory structure under ~/.dotfiles and manage everything with GNU Stow.

Colorsheme stuff is all base16 (http://github.com/chriskempson)
In the case of my laptop, where I use URxvt as my terminal emulator, the colors are set in both .Xresources AND with a shell script that lives in .config/base16-shell which is referenced in .bashrc. Ugh, the things you do for 256 colors.
On the desktop side, Termite handles 256 color themes just fine with no shell script hackery.
