| DOTFILESSSSSS |
'---------------'
I place this directory structure under ~/.dotfiles and manage everything with GNU Stow.


.========.
| COLORS |
'--------'
Colorsheme stuff is all base16 (http://github.com/chriskempson)

In the case of my laptop, where I use URxvt as my terminal emulator, the colors are set in both .Xresources AND with a shell script that lives in .config/base16-shell which is referenced in .bashrc. Ugh, the things you do for 256 colors.

On the desktop side, Termite handles 256 color themes just fine with no shell script hackery.


.=====.
| VIM |
'-----'
I'm really trying to keep vim as simple as possible. Switched to gvim FINALLY after learning that it can be run in a terminal without that ugly GUI. I love that clipboard support!

This is one I'll probably come back to and tweak as I figure out what features I actually use. (I'm looking at you, tab pages.)


.====.
| I3 |
'----'
Pretty standard, except shifting the movement keys over to the left so they're the same as vim's.

The desktop/laptop config separation is due to different packages being available in Arch vs Debian.

Prrrrrobably gonna change over from i3status to something else eventually.
